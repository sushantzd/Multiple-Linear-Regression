# Multiple-Linear-Regression
In this project, I implemented multiple linear regression using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The goal was to predict a target variable based on multiple features from the dataset. I learned the underlying concepts and techniques from the Udemy course "Complete Machine Learning" by Krish Naik.

This project includes:

* Data preprocessing and cleaning

* Implementing multiple linear regression using Python's scikit-learn

* Model evaluation using metrics like R-squared and MSE
